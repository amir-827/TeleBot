# TeleBot
A minimal library to develop your new Telegram bot

## Installation
`composer require webpajooh/telebot`

## How to use

### Start point
We start by creating an instance of `TeleBot` class:
```php
try {
    $tg = new TeleBot('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');
} catch (Throwable $th) {...}
```

### Get the update object
There are short ways to access the `update` object and some important fields. I recommend you to read [the official documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) to understand these objects well.
```
$tg->update
$tg->message
$tg->chat
$tg->user
```
You also can use the `hasCallbackQuery()` method, when you want to check if the `update` object has a `callback_query` field.

### Methods
Thanks to [magic methods](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php), we can use API methods without implementing them, and just call them by name and pass an array as parameter:
```php
$tg->editMessageText([...])
```

### Router
You may define some routes to your bot features; define them by the `listen()` method:
```php
$tg->listen('/start', function () use ($tg) {
    $tg->sendMessage([
        'chat_id' => $tg->user->id,
	'text' => 'Hello, world!',
    ]);
}, false);
```
The third parameter that is true by default, makes you able to terminate the script after running a command. In the previous example we passed `false` so script continues.

You can also get parameters and use them as variables:
```php
$tg->listen('set_age_%d', function ($age) use ($tg) {
    // TODO
});
```

TeleBot translates them to regex, so it will be good to take a look at this table to know how to use them properly:

| Type |TeleBot| Regex |
|--|--|--|
| Digits | %d | (\d+) |
| String (Anything but a whitespace) | %s | (\S+) |
| Character | %c | (\S) |
| Everything including an empty string| %p | (.*) |

### Logger
You may need to log something into a `log.txt` file:
```php
Logger::log($tg->user->id);
tl($tg->user->id); // Does the same thing
```

### Keyboard
TeleBot includes two classes for making keyboards; `InlineKeyboard` and `ReplyKeyboard`. Here you see an example:
```php
$keyboard = (new InlineKeyboard())
    ->addCallbackButton('üìï Help', 'help_callback')
    ->addUrlButton('üì± Share', 'https://t.me/share/url?url=https://t.me/your_awesome_bot&text=Some text')
    ->chunk(1)
    ->rightToLeft()
    ->get();
```
Then you can use it as bellow:
```php
$tg->sendMessage([
    // Other parameters
    'reply_markup' => $keyboard,
]);
```

Consider that the `chunk()` method supports more complex orders, just pass an array like [1, 3, 2] to build such a keyboard:  
<pre>
[        1        ]  
[ 2 ]  [ 3Ô∏è ]  [ 4 ]  
[   5   ] [   6   ]  
</pre>

### Default parameters
Sometimes you do not want to repeat yourself by passing a parameter everywhere, so you can define default parameters for each method. Here are three example that makes it clear how to use it:
```php
$tg->setDefaults('sendMessage', ['parse_mode' => 'html']); // You will not need passing parse_mode anymore
$tg->setDefaults(['sendMessage', 'banChatMember'], ['chat_id' => $chatId]);
$tg->setDefaults('*', ['chat_id' => $chatId]); // a default parameter for all methods
```

### Extend it!
You may want to add some methods to TeleBot class to improve your code readability and avoid duplication. Look at this simple example as an inspiration:
```php
TeleBot::extend('isReply', function () {
    return property_exists($this->message, 'reply_to_message');
});

if ($tg->isReply()) { ... }
```
